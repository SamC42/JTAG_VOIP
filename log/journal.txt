6:00pm - Got Package
7:00pm - Emailed about Error in package, Ordered another Phone from Amazon, should be here friday
7:15pm - Idea
        - Use ssh access to get firmware image and use hint 4 to decode message
7:52pm - Data

8:24pm - Downloaded Bin File from GrandStream Website (http://www.grandstream.com/support/firmware)
          - Version 1.0.2.27
8:43pm - Could potentionally get the firmware off of the phone, if it has been mod'd and compare to normal bin file, with binwalk -G

9:00pm - output of binwalk -Y --Identify the CPU architecture of a file using the capstone disassembler
	263 0x107 CPU - ARM executable code, 16-bit (Thumb), big endian, at least 500 valid instructions
11:00pm 
	-ssh uses Dropbear sshd 2013.58 (protocol 2.0) 
		-known to have different time delays between failed logon attempst to detect what usernames are valid
12:00am
	-Get into Linux via ssh to get to root to check out ssh/admin/admin/hlm0mz
	-Get into Linua via some other method
12/18/2016
7:00pm - Current Task will be to Exploit the ssh vulnerability 
	CVE - 2013 - 4421 which states 'Error in buf_decompress when handling compressed payloads can be exploited to exhaust
			                available memory resources by sending a speically crafted packet.
	- Plan is to download dropbear ssh version .58 and .59 and attempt to exploit compression packet error
12/19/2016
7:19am - Plan is to read into scp/ssh/dropbear to learn as much as possible to exploit
		CVE -2013 - 4421
	Dropbear - 
		- pty = pseudo-teletype - device
		- scp on dropbear need to install (looks like phone has it )
		- packet.c/line370 
			- buf_decompress(buf,len) = decompress payload, resize output buffer
				- uses zlib.net/zlib_tech.html
					- compression method, ecapsulates DEFALTE data by adding a header & trailer
8:00am - Broke out buf_decompress from packet.c to test buffer vulnerability
		- Assumptions - the buffer refered to is what is being taken in from ssh & w/ the vulnerabilty it will
				dump me out of the gradstream shell
					- don't use -T
                              - also to note the vul. only states that it can create a DOS but hopefully that will do the trick
					
		- expected results - it will all me to run code on the device
		
7:30pm
	- Stopped trying to decompress packet.c
	- tried a bit of brute force, going to look into why root@ for ssh stops at one password attempt
	- heredoc tried
9:00pm
	- Attempting to get in via a serial port
	- Also trying to look at maintenance mode somewhere on the machine
	- DRAM = Zentel A353%%40GTP
	- Processor ARM 926 
	- SoC = DVF9918 

02/22/2016
8:53am
	- Attempting still getting in via port holes located on pcb
	- The DVF99 has:
			2 usb
			2 UART
			SPI Master and SPI m/s
			2 I2C buses
	- Debug - JTAG-based debug port for both CPU's 
		- CoreSight w/ Embedded Trace Macrocell 
		- Maybe the pinout is a JTAG debug port
