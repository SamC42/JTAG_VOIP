JTAG discovery:

TDI - Test Data In
TDO - Test Data Out
TCK - Test CLK
TMS - TMS
TRST - Test Reset (optional)

- Bits are passed via rising edge (NEED A OSCILLISCOPE!!!) of TCK
* An FPGA would be ideal
- Basically a state machine, run on the clock edge of Test, lets see
	if the Arduino can handle it

Plan:

1. Create a MIPS Assemby instruction test script in binary
2. Pass the binary to the Arduino JTAG program clocked at JTag speed
3. Interpret
