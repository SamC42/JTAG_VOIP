dv99_sim - contains the Arduino source code writtent to interpret the JTAG information



JTAG discovery:

TDI - Test Data In
TDO - Test Data Out
TCK - Test CLK
TMS - TMS
TRST - Test Reset (optional)

- Bits are passed via rising edge (NEED A OSCILLISCOPE!!!) of TCK
* An FPGA would be ideal
- Basically a state machine, run on the clock edge of Test, lets see
	if the Arduino can handle it

Plan:

1. Create an ARM Assemby instruction test script in binary
2. Pass the binary to the Arduino JTAG program clocked at TCK speed
3. Interpret
4. Set Breakpoints and insert code along JTAG line (Not Completed)
